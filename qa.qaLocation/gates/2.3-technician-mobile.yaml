statusSummary: |
  CONCERNS - The Technician Mobile App has a solid architectural foundation
  but requires significant work in security, testing, and performance
  before production deployment. The mock authentication system must be
  replaced, comprehensive testing added, and performance optimization
  implemented. Do not deploy to production without addressing critical
  security and testing requirements.
