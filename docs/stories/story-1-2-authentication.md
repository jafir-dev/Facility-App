# Story: Authentication System & User Management

**Story ID**: Story 1-2
**Branch**: `feature/story-1-2`
**Dependencies**: None
**Parallel-safe**: true
**Module**: Authentication service and user domain
**Epic**: Foundation & Core Ticketing Workflow

## User Story
**As a** user, **I want** to sign up and log in with my email and password, **so that** I can securely access the platform.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A user can create a new account with an email, password, and one of the three core roles (Tenant, Supervisor, Technician)
2. A registered user can log in to receive a secure access token (JWT)
3. All subsequent API endpoints are protected with authentication
4. Role-based access control (RBAC) is implemented
5. User management endpoints for CRUD operations
6. Password reset functionality
7. Session management and token refresh

## Technical Implementation Details

### Firebase Authentication Integration
- Integrate Firebase Authentication SDK
- Configure authentication providers (email/password)
- Handle user registration and login flows
- Implement token validation middleware
- Set up Firebase Admin SDK for server-side operations

### User Role Management
```typescript
// packages/shared-types/src/user.ts
export type UserRole = 'Tenant' | 'Supervisor' | 'Technician' | 'FMCHead' | 'Owner' | 'Procurement' | 'Vendor';

export interface User {
  id: string; // Firebase UID
  email: string;
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  role: UserRole;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
  isActive: boolean;
}
```

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `POST /api/auth/refresh` - Token refresh
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - User logout
- `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` - Password reset request
- `POST /api/auth/reset-password` - Password reset confirmation
- `GET /api/users/me` - Get current user profile
- `PUT /api/users/me` - Update current user profile
- `GET /api/users` - List users (admin only)
- `GET /api/users/:id` - Get user by ID (admin only)

### Security Implementation
- JWT token validation middleware
- Role-based authorization decorators
- Rate limiting for auth endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure password handling
- CORS configuration

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE "users" (
    "id" TEXT PRIMARY KEY, -- Firebase UID
    "email" TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    "first_name" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "last_name" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "role" user_role NOT NULL,
    "is_active" BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
    "created_at" TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    "updated_at" TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Frontend Integration
- Authentication context/providers for React and Flutter
- Protected route components
- Login and registration forms
- User profile management
- Token persistence and refresh logic

## Success Metrics
- ✅ User registration works with email verification
- ✅ User login returns valid JWT tokens
- ✅ Protected endpoints reject unauthenticated requests
- ✅ Role-based access control prevents unauthorized access
- ✅ Password reset flow completes successfully
- ✅ Token refresh mechanism works seamlessly
- ✅ User profile updates are persisted correctly

## Notes for Developers
- Focus on the three core roles first (Tenant, Supervisor, Technician)
- Implement Firebase Auth as the primary authentication method
- Use Firebase Admin SDK for server-side token verification
- Create comprehensive error handling for auth failures
- Ensure proper logging of authentication events
- Test with different user roles and permissions
- Document authentication flow and security measures

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-30

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The authentication system implementation demonstrates strong engineering practices with excellent separation of concerns, clean architecture, and comprehensive security measures. The Firebase Authentication integration is well-implemented with proper JWT token management and role-based access control. Code quality is high with consistent patterns, proper error handling, and good maintainability.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: src/middleware/auth.middleware.js
  - **Change**: Fixed JWT service initialization issue in middleware
  - **Why**: Integration tests were failing due to uninitialized JWT service
  - **How**: Added proper JWT service instantiation with configuration injection

- **File**: src/services/auth.service.js
  - **Change**: Added conditional console.error logging for test environment
  - **Why**: Test output was cluttered with expected error messages
  - **How**: Wrapped console.error statements with NODE_ENV check

- **File**: tests/integration/auth.routes.test.js
  - **Change**: Updated test to use valid JWT tokens instead of mock strings
  - **Why**: Authentication middleware was rejecting mock tokens
  - **How**: Generated real JWT tokens using test configuration

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Excellent adherence to JavaScript best practices
- Project Structure: ✓ Well-organized with clear separation of concerns
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive coverage with unit and integration tests
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 7 acceptance criteria fully implemented and tested

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Fixed JWT service initialization in auth middleware
- [x] Cleaned up test logging output
- [x] Fixed integration test token validation
- [x] Implement token blacklisting for logout functionality
- [x] Add password strength validation requirements
- [x] Implement email verification flow post-registration
- [x] Add comprehensive audit logging for security events

### Security Review

The authentication system demonstrates strong security practices:
- Firebase Authentication provides enterprise-grade security
- JWT tokens with proper expiration times (1h access, 7d refresh)
- Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks (5 attempts/15min for login)
- Input validation and sanitization using express-validator
- CORS configuration with environment-specific origins
- Role-based access control with proper authorization checks
- Secure password handling through Firebase (no plaintext storage)
- Database parameterization prevents SQL injection

### Performance Considerations

Performance is well-optimized with:
- Efficient database queries using PostgreSQL with proper indexing
- JWT tokens minimize database calls for authentication
- Rate limiting prevents abuse and ensures service availability
- Connection pooling for database connections
- Caching opportunities identified for future optimization
