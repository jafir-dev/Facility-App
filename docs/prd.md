# Zariya Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## **Goals and Background Context**

### **Goals**
* **For the Business:**
    * Improve operational efficiency for Facility Management Companies (FMCs) by reducing ticket resolution time by 30%.
    * Achieve market validation by onboarding 10 paying FMCs within the first year.
    * Increase property value for building owners by demonstrably improving tenant retention rates.
* **For the Users:**
    * Achieve a high tenant satisfaction score (4.5/5 stars) on completed maintenance work.
    * Increase FMC staff productivity by reducing manual communications per ticket by 50%.
    * Ensure a high first-time fix rate, verified by a customer OTP flow.

### **Background Context**
The current process for managing property maintenance is fragmented, relying on inefficient channels like phone calls and WhatsApp. This leads to poor communication, a lack of transparency for tenants, and significant operational overhead for FMCs. Existing generic software fails to address the unique, multi-role workflow of the facility management industry.

Zariya aims to solve this by providing a unified, mobile-first platform with tailored applications for both tenants and operational staff. It will digitize the entire maintenance lifecycle, creating a single source of truth that increases efficiency, improves service quality, and enhances communication for all stakeholders involved.

## **Requirements**

### **Functional Requirements**
1.  **FR1:** The system must support seven distinct user roles (Tenant, Building Owner, FMC Head, Supervisor, Technician, Procurement, Vendor) with granular Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
2.  **FR2:** Tenants must be able to create a maintenance ticket that includes a description, photos, and video attachments.
3.  **FR3:** Supervisors must be able to view, assign, and monitor the status of all tickets within their assigned properties.
4.  **FR4:** The system must support a quoting mechanism for paid work, which requires tenant approval before proceeding.
5.  **FR5:** The system must include a procurement workflow for supervisors to request and the procurement team to manage materials for a job.
6.  **FR6:** Technicians must be able to view their assigned tickets, update their status, and upload "before and after" photos/videos.
7.  **FR7:** The system must implement an OTP (One-Time Password) flow where the tenant provides a code to the technician to verify a job's satisfactory completion.
8.  **FR8:** The system will automatically generate invoices and receipts for paid work upon verified completion.
9.  **FR9:** The system will send notifications for critical ticket events via in-app, push, and email channels.

## **User Interface Design Goals**

### **Overall UX Vision**
A clean, modern, and intuitive user experience that instills confidence and transparency. The design should prioritize clarity and ease-of-use, enabling tenants to report issues effortlessly and FMC staff to manage their workflows with maximum efficiency. The interface should feel user-friendly and simple.

### **Key Interaction Paradigms**
The platform will follow established mobile-first design patterns. Key interactions will include tap-to-act buttons, swipeable lists, and a clear, persistent navigation structure. A floating action button (+) will be the primary call-to-action for creating a new ticket in the tenant app.

### **Core Screens and Views**
* **Tenant App:** Splash, Onboarding Carousel, Authentication (Sign in/up), Dashboard, New Request Form, Ticket Details/Status View, Settings.
* **Operational App:** Splash, Authentication, Role-Based Dashboard (Supervisor/Technician view), Ticket List, Ticket Details View, Assignment View, Team Management (Supervisor).

### **Accessibility**
The applications should adhere to **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** standards to ensure usability for people with disabilities. This includes support for screen readers, sufficient color contrast, and scalable text. **Arabic language support** is a mandatory requirement.

### **Branding**
To be defined. The design must allow for the easy application of an FMC client's branding (e.g., their company logo and colors) on tenant-facing documents like receipts and invoices.

### **Target Device and Platforms**
The primary platforms are **iOS** and **Android** via a Flutter-based mobile application, complemented by a **responsive web portal** for administrative tasks.

---
## **Technical Assumptions**

### **Repository Structure: Monorepo**
The project will be developed within a single monorepo (e.g., using Nx or Turborepo) to streamline development by simplifying code sharing between the Flutter mobile app, the React web portal, and the Node.js backend.

### **Service Architecture: Modular Monolith**
For the V1.0 launch, the backend will be built as a modular monolith. This architecture provides development velocity while enforcing strong domain boundaries, allowing for a future evolution into microservices if required.

### **Testing Requirements: Full Testing Pyramid**
A comprehensive testing strategy is required, including Unit Tests, Integration Tests, and End-to-End (E2E) Tests to ensure quality and stability.

### **Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests**
* **Mobile Frontend:** Flutter
* **Web Frontend:** React (Next.js)
* **Backend:** Node.js (NestJS)
* **Database:** PostgreSQL
* **Infrastructure:** AWS

## **Epic List**

* **Epic 1: Foundation & Core Ticketing Workflow**
    * **Goal:** Establish the project's technical foundation, implement the core user roles (Tenant, Supervisor, Technician), and enable the end-to-end flow of creating, assigning, and completing a basic maintenance ticket.
* **Epic 2: Quoting, Verification & Advanced Media**
    * **Goal:** Enhance the core workflow by introducing the system for paid work, including quote generation and tenant approvals, adding video support to tickets, and implementing the OTP completion flow for secure handover.
* **Epic 3: Management Roles & Financials**
    * **Goal:** Onboard the remaining user roles (Building Owner, FMC Head, Procurement, Vendor) and build out the core financial features, including automated invoicing, receipt generation, and the initial analytics dashboards.
* **Epic 4: Communications & Go-to-Market**
    * **Goal:** Integrate the full communication suite, including the in-app chat and email notifications, and develop the public-facing landing page with the tiered pricing model to prepare for launch.
