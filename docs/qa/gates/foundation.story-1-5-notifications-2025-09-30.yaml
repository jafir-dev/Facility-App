# Risk Assessment
risks:
  security:
    level: "HIGH"
    description: "Missing authentication, authorization, input validation, and rate limiting"
    mitigation: "Implement security middleware and validation before production"

  operational:
    level: "MEDIUM"
    description: "Missing monitoring, health checks, and operational documentation"
    mitigation: "Add monitoring endpoints and documentation"

  completeness:
    level: "MEDIUM"
    description: "Several services have mock implementations instead of real integrations"
    mitigation: "Complete real integrations before deployment"

  performance:
    level: "LOW"
    description: "Performance is generally good but could benefit from caching"
    mitigation: "Add Redis caching for frequently accessed data"
