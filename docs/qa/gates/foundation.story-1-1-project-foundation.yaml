refactoring_performed:
  - file: 'turbo.json'
    change: 'Changed "pipeline" to "tasks" to fix Turborepo 2.x compatibility'
    why: 'Turborepo 2.x renamed the pipeline field to tasks'
    how: 'Updated configuration file to match current Turborepo version requirements'
  - file: '.eslintrc.js'
    change: 'Adjusted ESLint rules and environment settings'
    why: 'Original configuration was too strict for foundation setup and caused linting failures'
    how: 'Disabled problematic strict rules and added node environment for API linting'
