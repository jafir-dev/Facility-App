# **Introduction**

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for Zariya, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

## **Starter Template or Existing Project**
The PRD (Story 1.1) specifies setting up a monorepo with initial scaffolding. To accelerate this, we will use a well-structured, modern starter template like the T3 Stack or a similar Turborepo starter with Next.js and NestJS. This provides pre-configured tooling, end-to-end type safety, and best practices from day one.
