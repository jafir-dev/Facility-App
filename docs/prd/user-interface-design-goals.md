# **User Interface Design Goals**

## **Overall UX Vision**
A clean, modern, and intuitive user experience that instills confidence and transparency. The design should prioritize clarity and ease-of-use, enabling tenants to report issues effortlessly and FMC staff to manage their workflows with maximum efficiency. The interface should feel user-friendly and simple.

## **Key Interaction Paradigms**
The platform will follow established mobile-first design patterns. Key interactions will include tap-to-act buttons, swipeable lists, and a clear, persistent navigation structure. A floating action button (+) will be the primary call-to-action for creating a new ticket in the tenant app.

## **Core Screens and Views**
* **Tenant App:** Splash, Onboarding Carousel, Authentication (Sign in/up), Dashboard, New Request Form, Ticket Details/Status View, Settings.
* **Operational App:** Splash, Authentication, Role-Based Dashboard (Supervisor/Technician view), Ticket List, Ticket Details View, Assignment View, Team Management (Supervisor).

## **Accessibility**
The applications should adhere to **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** standards to ensure usability for people with disabilities. This includes support for screen readers, sufficient color contrast, and scalable text. **Arabic language support** is a mandatory requirement.

## **Branding**
To be defined. The design must allow for the easy application of an FMC client's branding (e.g., their company logo and colors) on tenant-facing documents like receipts and invoices.

## **Target Device and Platforms**
The primary platforms are **iOS** and **Android** via a Flutter-based mobile application, complemented by a **responsive web portal** for administrative tasks.
