# **Goals and Background Context**

## **Goals**
* **For the Business:**
    * Improve operational efficiency for Facility Management Companies (FMCs) by reducing ticket resolution time by 30%.
    * Achieve market validation by onboarding 10 paying FMCs within the first year.
    * Increase property value for building owners by demonstrably improving tenant retention rates.
* **For the Users:**
    * Achieve a high tenant satisfaction score (4.5/5 stars) on completed maintenance work.
    * Increase FMC staff productivity by reducing manual communications per ticket by 50%.
    * Ensure a high first-time fix rate, verified by a customer OTP flow.

## **Background Context**
The current process for managing property maintenance is fragmented, relying on inefficient channels like phone calls and WhatsApp. This leads to poor communication, a lack of transparency for tenants, and significant operational overhead for FMCs. Existing generic software fails to address the unique, multi-role workflow of the facility management industry.

Zariya aims to solve this by providing a unified, mobile-first platform with tailored applications for both tenants and operational staff. It will digitize the entire maintenance lifecycle, creating a single source of truth that increases efficiency, improves service quality, and enhances communication for all stakeholders involved.
